Update-Checker
==============

To keep track of your TV Series, Movies, Blu-ray, RSS and more (with a RegExp), install the [Update Checker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gijloegddjacahpkmofechkbpefckhio) extension from your Google Chrome browser.

Update Checker allows you to track regularly (you will get notifications for it):

* TV series next episode release dates,
* Movies release dates,
* Blu-ray release dates,
* RSS feeds,
* Any webpage with a RegExp (some predefined website-specific RegExps are available).

N.B.: If you want to try our GitHub version, follow this [tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).

Enjoy!
